<p>This is a page of a engineer's degree repository. The main clue of this engineer's is to compare the most popular technologies for a parallel computations on Intel Xeon Phi Accelerator. Feel free to fork. Repository is under Apache License.</p>

<p>Following project resolves the issues, in the field of Computer Science, related to parallel computing. This is a type of calculation, wherein many instructions are executed simultaneously. Currently there are multiple existing technologies, which can be used in implementation of such a model, but the purpose of this project is to compare the Message Passing Interface, Open Multi Processing and Open Computing Language on the accelerator Intel Xeon Phi 5120. The comparison was made for the three main problem areas associated with this type of computations. Those are a large number of calculations, the enormity of the data and a multitude of the communication. In order to illustrate this problem, in the context of this paper, the total number of twelve applications, four for each of the mentioned areas, had been made. Among implementation there is a serial version, which was the basis used for creation of a MPI, OpenMP and OpenCL versions, so that the comparison was fair and correct. It is worth noting
that in the project offload model was used, so the appropriate algorithm computations were performed only on the coprocessor site.
Applications, which illustrate the problems, are performing vizualization of Mandelbrot set (a large number of simple computations), creation of an image consisting of rectangles which are generated using genetic algorithm (calculations on extensive data), and the simulation of a clientserver architecture (high intensity of communication). At the end of this paper, the results of the comparison were presented, and the best technologies, regarding selected problem areas, were pointed. Optimizations, which could
complement the essence of this project, were also proposed.</p>
